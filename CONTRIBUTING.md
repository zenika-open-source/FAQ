### Commit messages

This project uses [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) as the commit convention, because it's fun and provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit only by looking at the emojis used. All you have to do is to find the emoji corresponding to the purpose of your commit in [this list](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/), followed by a short message explaining the update. You can also add a description if it's needed. That's all ;)
