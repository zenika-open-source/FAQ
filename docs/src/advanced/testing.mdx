# Testing

The project uses Playwright to run end-to-end tests.  
Here are the steps to make the tests work.

## 1/ Install the dependencies

```bash
# Path: ./FAQ/e2e
npm install
```

## 2/ Update your environment files

- In the `.env.local` of the `client` folder add

```bash
REACT_APP_DISABLE_AUTH=true
```

- In the `.env.local` of the `server` folder add

```bash
SKIP_AUTH=true
```

These will make Playwright skip the auth0 authentication and avoid the redirection

## 3/ Launch the tests

- In your terminal, go in the `e2e` folder
- Use `npm run test` to start the tests
  - Use `npm run test:headed` to start the tests with a browser opening and closing for each test
  - Use `npm run test:trace` to start the tests with the trace on. The trace is a record of every action made by Playwright in a test.
