# Testing

The project uses Playwright to run end-to-end tests.  
Here are the steps to make the tests work.

## 1/ Install the dependencies

```bash
# Path: ./FAQ/e2e
npm install
```

## 2/ Update your environment files

- In the `.env.local` of the `client` folder add

```bash
REACT_APP_AUTH_SKIP=skipAuth
```

- In the `.env.local` of the `server` folder add

```bash
AUTH_SKIP=skipAuth

USER_ID=
USER_EMAIL=
```

These will make Playwright skip the auth0 authentification and avoid the redirection

### How to get USER_ID and USER_EMAIL values ?

You need to create a new user in the Prisma Playground at http://localhost:4466

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(
    data: { key: "awesome-key", name: "API", email: "awesome-api@zenika.com" }
  ) {
    id
    email
  }
}
```

Use the values returned as your USER_ID and USER_EMAIL

**⚠️ The email MUST end with @zenika.com ⚠️**

## 3/ Launch the tests

- In your terminal, go in the `e2e` folder
- Use `npm run test` to start the tests
  - Use `npm run test:headed` to start the tests with a browser opening and closing for each tests
  - Use `npm run test:trace` to start the tests with the trace on. The trace is a record of every action done by Playwright in a test.
